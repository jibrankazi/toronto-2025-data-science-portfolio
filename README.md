# toronto-2025-data-science-portfolio
Portfolio repository showcasing five end-to-end data science projects for Toronto’s 2025 job market, covering forecasting, causal inference, climate risk, NLP, and optimization.

## Projects

- **Predictive Modeling of Canadian Financial Markets** – [Repository](https://github.com/jibrankazi/canadian-financial-forecasting)  
  Time-series forecasting of CAD/USD exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the TSX Composite index using ARIMA, Prophet, and VAR models. Includes scripts for data extraction from Bank of Canada and free market APIs, forecasting notebooks, and a Power BI dashboard.

- **Causal Analysis of Ontario Public Health Interventions** – [Repository](https://github.com/jibrankazi/ontario-health-causal-analysis)  
  Evaluates the causal impact of a public health policy using difference-in-differences, propensity score matching (PSM), and a Bayesian structural time-series (CausalImpact) approach. Contains R Markdown analysis, data preparation, and a Tableau story.

- **Climate Risk Assessment for Toronto Infrastructure** – [Repository](https://github.com/jibrankazi/toronto-climate-risk-assessment)  
  Combines climate projection data with infrastructure maps to compute a composite climate risk index across Toronto neighborhoods. Includes geospatial data processing scripts, risk index computation, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

- **NLP-Driven Market Readiness for Open Banking in Canada** – [Repository](https://github.com/jibrankazi/open-banking-nlp-analysis)  
  Uses FinBERT sentiment analysis and BERTopic topic modeling to analyze Canadian Open Banking discourse from news articles, press releases, and government reports. Provides data collection scripts, NLP analysis notebooks, and a Power BI dashboard.

- **Prescriptive Analytics for Social Impact Funding** – [Repository](https://github.com/jibrankazi/social-impact-funding-optimizer)  
  Develops a predictive model to estimate project impact and formulates an optimization model (using PuLP) to allocate grant funding for maximum social benefit. Includes data simulation/processing, model training, optimization scripts, and a Tableau dashboard.
